CHALLENGES FACED
I had issues collecting some images from the figma file given so I used some images simiar to the one workflow from pexels.com to make up for it.
I also had issues using the figma icons so I used the ones from remixicons.
I also had issues of light which slowed me down a bit.
Aside from the aforementioned, the task was quite inciteful exhilirating which help me think logically...
