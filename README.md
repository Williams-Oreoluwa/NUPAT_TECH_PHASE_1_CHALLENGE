Although this project is none responsive,some parts of the project may not appear to look organised on your computer due to the different screen sizes of PC...This is subject to determination to complete the project before the deadline. Hence, I suggest toggling the plus or minus zoom Icon on your browser...View the image below if not clear...![Screenshot 2023-03-30 134656](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105238634/228945227-ab53aecd-da15-4df4-971e-2b07ecc09db8.jpg)

This portion may look distorted so I suggest toggling your zoom button..
CHALLENGES FACED
I had issues collecting some images from the figma file given so I used some images simiar to the one on the workflow from pexels.com to make up for it.
I also had issues using the figma icons so I used the ones from remixicons.com.
There was also issues as regards to light which slowed me down a bit.
Aside from the aforementioned, the task was quite inciteful and exhilirating which helped me think logically to tackle some CSS problems...
